# Robotic Arm
I am currently working on creating a robotic arm that utilizes 3D modelling, 3D printing, circuitry and programming.

These are some of the pieces that will be sent to a 3D printer for printing.

Using PLA I printed the modelled pieces to create the frame of the robotic arm.

Assembling the 3D printed components and wiring the Arduino board.
